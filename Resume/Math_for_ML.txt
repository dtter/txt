- 3 major components in ML: data, models, and learning
- the data is represented in tabular format by computer, that
should be converted into numbers
- important to use domain knowledge when constructing the representation
- Even numerical data that could potentially be
directly read into a machine learning algorithm should be carefully 
considered for units, scaling, and constraints

D-dimensional vector
N : number of examples in a dataset
n : index of examples (nth of N examples)
D : feature of interest about the example
d : 

3 Distinct algorithmic phases:
1. prediction/inference : the parameters and model choice is already
fixed and the predictor is applied to new vectors representing new input
data points
2. training/parameter estimation : adjust our predictive model based on 
training data.
3. hyperparameter tuning/model selection

LR: 264 (empirical risk minimization)
