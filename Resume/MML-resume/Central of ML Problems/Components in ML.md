- 3 major components in ML:
	- data
	- models
	- learning
- The data is represented in tabular format by computer, that should be converted into numbers
- important to use domain knowledge when constructing the representation
- Even numerical data that could potentially be directly read into a machine learning algorithm should be carefully considered for units, scaling, and constraints
